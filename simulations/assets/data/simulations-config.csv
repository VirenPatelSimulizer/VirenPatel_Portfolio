sim001,Brownian Motion (Swarm Optimization),Watch particles collaborate to find optimal solutions using swarm intelligence algorithms.,"This simulation demonstrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a computational method inspired by bird flocking and fish schooling. Particles move through the solution space, sharing information about good positions they've found. Over time, the swarm converges on optimal solutions. Adjust parameters like swarm size, inertia weight, and cognitive/social coefficients to see how they affect convergence speed and accuracy.",Optimization,optimization | swarm-intelligence | algorithm | ai | emergent-behavior,sims/sim1.html,video,assets/videos/previews/particle-swarm-preview.mp4,assets/images/previews/particle-swarm-preview.png,Intermediate,5-10 minutes,Real-time parameter adjustment | Multiple optimization functions | Performance metrics visualization | Export results as CSV,active
sim002,Gravity Wells,Observe how masses attract each other and form orbital systems under Newtonian gravity.,"This simulation models gravitational attraction between multiple particles following Newton's law of universal gravitation. Users can spawn new bodies, adjust their mass and velocity, and visualize how gravitational forces create orbits, collisions, and chaotic systems. Perfect for understanding how emergent order can arise from simple physical laws.",Physics,gravity | particle | emergent-behavior | motion | simulation,sims/sim2.html,video,assets/videos/previews/gravity-wells-preview.mp4,assets/images/previews/gravity-wells-preview.png,Beginner,3-8 minutes,Adjustable gravity constant | Real-time orbits | Collision and merge visualization | Energy conservation graph,active
sim003,Charged Particle Field,Explore the dynamic interactions between positive and negative charges in an electric field.,"This simulation showcases Coulomb's Law and electrostatic interactions. Particles with positive and negative charges attract or repel each other depending on their polarity. Observe how clusters, equilibrium states, and oscillatory behaviors emerge from simple force rules. Users can control charge strength, particle density, and field visualization modes to see different emergent behaviors.",Physics,charge | electrostatics | emergent-behavior | field | simulation,sims/sim3.html,video,assets/videos/previews/charged-particle-preview.mp4,assets/images/previews/charged-particle-preview.png,Intermediate,5-12 minutes,Adjustable charge strength | Field line visualization | Cluster formation analysis | Real-time force vectors,active

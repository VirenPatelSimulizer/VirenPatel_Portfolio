sim001,Particle Swarm Optimization,Watch particles collaborate to find optimal solutions using swarm intelligence algorithms.,"This simulation demonstrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a computational method inspired by bird flocking and fish schooling. Particles move through the solution space, sharing information about good positions they've found. Over time, the swarm converges on optimal solutions. Adjust parameters like swarm size, inertia weight, and cognitive/social factors to see how they affect convergence speed and solution quality.",swarm,"optimization|swarm-intelligence|algorithm|ai|emergent-behavior",sims/particle-swarm.html,video,assets/videos/previews/particle-swarm-preview.mp4,assets/images/previews/particle-swarm-preview.png,intermediate,5-10 minutes,"Real-time parameter adjustment|Multiple optimization functions|Performance metrics visualization|Export results as CSV",active
sim002,Boids Flocking Simulation,Experience realistic flocking behavior with autonomous agents following simple rules.,"Based on Craig Reynolds' Boids algorithm, this simulation creates lifelike flocking behavior using three simple rules: separation (avoid crowding), alignment (steer towards average heading), and cohesion (move toward average position). Despite the simplicity of individual rules, complex emergent patterns arise. Experiment with different rule weights, add obstacles, or introduce predators to see how the flock adapts.",swarm,"boids|flocking|emergent-behavior|agent-based|artificial-life",sims/boids-flocking.html,video,assets/videos/previews/boids-preview.mp4,assets/images/previews/boids-preview.png,beginner,3-5 minutes,"Adjustable flock size|Interactive obstacles|Predator-prey dynamics|3D visualization mode",active
sim003,Double Pendulum Chaos,Witness chaotic motion in a simple mechanical system with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions.,"The double pendulum is one of the simplest systems that exhibits chaotic behavior. Two pendulums connected end-to-end create unpredictable, non-repeating motion patterns. Even tiny differences in starting positions lead to dramatically different trajectories.

sim006,Ant Colony Optimization,Watch virtual ants find optimal paths using pheromone trails and collective intelligence.,"Inspired by real ant foraging behavior, this simulation demonstrates how simple agents can solve complex optimization problems. Virtual ants explore paths between food sources and their nest, leaving pheromone trails. Shorter paths accumulate more pheromone as ants complete trips faster, attracting more ants. Over time, the colony converges on near-optimal solutions.
